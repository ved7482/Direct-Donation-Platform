# Direct Donation Platform Smart Contract

## Introduction
The Direct Donation Platform is a smart contract that allows beneficiaries to register themselves and receive direct donations from donors on the Aptos blockchain.

## Vision
The goal of this project is to provide a simple and efficient platform for direct donations, enabling beneficiaries to receive funds directly from donors without intermediaries. This aims to maximize the impact of donations and reduce overhead costs.

## Future Goals
- Allow beneficiaries to update their profile information (e.g., deactivate their account, update contact details)
- Implement a withdrawal mechanism for beneficiaries to claim their donations
- Support donations in other token types beyond just AptosCoin
- Explore donation matching or campaign features
